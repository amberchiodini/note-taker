## Description: 
I created an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes using Express.js. 

## First Look:

## Technologies used: 
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation: 
You must first run ```npm install``` into your CLI to install all dependencies. To use the application locally, run ```node server.js``` into your CLI and then open ```http://localhost:3000``` into your browser. 

To deploy onto [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), set-up an account and then run ```heroku login```, ```heroku create```, and ```git push heroku main``` into your CLI.
